# CatApp
Web app created using the Cat API




Hi Miguel,

 

Good news, it sounds like your call went well today?  Thank you for your interest in working at Motor Trend Group. We have prepared a small assignment for you to demonstrate your coding and problem solving abilities. We hope to see code quality, design decisions, as well as the use of testing. You can work on this task on your own time. After reviewing the below, when do you think you can complete this and return it to me?

 

Assignment:

 

You will be working with the following API: http://thecatapi.com/

 

Please read and familiarize yourself with the documentation and features. Your mission, if you choose to accept, will be to digest and interact with the data.

 

Requirements

   *  Use React to build your application

   *  Generate an API authentication token and manage it within the application.

   *  Build a UI that will display the data digested from the API.

   *  Should include a view that displays images within a scrollable table view.

   *  Should allow the user to favorite an image(i.e. jpeg/png, and gifs).

   *  Should provide a section or area or page that lists the user's favorites.

   *  Provide a README about this application and how-to-run-it.

 

Bonus (but not required)

  *  Navigation for browsing by category.

  *  Allow for filtering of images by jpeg, png, gif, and category (default to all).

  *  Provide an alert or notification if/when API is offline.

  *  Utilize tests when needed (e.g. unit, cases, mocks).

 

Notes

  *   Do not worry about design. A simple UI boilerplate or native UI elements will do.

  *   Completeness is not required, do enough of each requirement to show your understanding of the requirement and your approach.
